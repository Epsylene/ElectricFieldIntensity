# ElectricFieldIntensity
A visualisation of the intensity of the electric field created by a set of charges.

Left-click to add a positive particle, right-click to add a negative one. Press `X` to remove the last particle added and `Shift + X` to remove all particles.

You can choose between three drawing modes: **Ugly** (press `1`), **Beauty** (press `2`), and **Text** (press `3`), and switch between the real formula to calculate the electric field and a modified one with the `R` key.
