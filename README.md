# ElectricFieldIntensity
A visualisation of the intensity of the electric field created by a set of charges.

Left-click to add a positive particle, right-click to add a negative one. Press `X` to remove the last particle added and `Shift + X` to remove all particles.

You can choose between three drawing modes:
1. **Ugly** (press `1`): positive particles are white, negative particles black. In the areas where the field generated by the positive particles is greater than the one generated by the negative particles, background is red, and blue in the opposite case.

2. **Beauty** (press `2`): same principle than Ugly, but background color is a blue-white-red gradient based on the intensity of the field at each point.

3. **Text** (press `3`): just for fun. Each number corresponds to the magnitude of the electric field at that point (actually, when *Realistic* flag is off, the field is multiplied by a factor of a 100 and rounded; otherwise, it is way too weak).

There is also a *Realistic* flag which can be set on and off with `R`; in the first case, the field is calculated with the standard formula, in the second, with a modified one.

## Build tools

The code was written in C++17 (although any version higher than C++11 should be fine) and compiled with Mingw-w64 7.3.0 32-bits. SFML 2.5.1 32-bits and CMake 3.15 were used.
